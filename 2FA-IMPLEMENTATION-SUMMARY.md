# BloodConnect 2FA Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system for your BloodConnect application using Firebase. Here's what was added:

### ✅ Core Features

1. **Email Verification** - Required for all new accounts
2. **Two-Factor Authentication** - Optional security enhancement
3. **SMS-based 2FA** - Using Firebase Phone Authentication
4. **Email-based 2FA** - Custom verification codes
5. **2FA Management** - Users can enable/disable 2FA settings

### 📁 New Files Created

1. **`verify-email.html`** - Email verification page for new users
2. **`verify-2fa.html`** - 2FA verification page during login
3. **`2fa-settings.html`** - User settings page to manage 2FA
4. **`firebase-setup-guide.md`** - Complete setup instructions
5. **`2FA-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

### 🔧 Modified Files

1. **`login.html`** - Updated to check email verification and 2FA status
2. **`Signup.html`** - Updated to require email verification
3. **`donatordashboard.html`** - Added security settings link

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Registration Flow
```
Sign Up → Email Verification Required → Account Activated
```

### 2. Login Flow (Without 2FA)
```
Login → Email Verified? → Yes → Dashboard
```

### 3. Login Flow (With 2FA Enabled)
```
Login → Email Verified? → Yes → 2FA Enabled? → Yes → 2FA Verification → Dashboard
```

### 4. 2FA Setup Flow
```
Dashboard → Security Settings → Add Phone Number → Enable 2FA
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Firebase Services Used
- **Firebase Authentication** - User management and email verification
- **Firebase Phone Auth** - SMS verification
- **Firestore** - User data storage and 2FA settings
- **reCAPTCHA** - Phone verification security

### Data Structure
```javascript
// User document in Firestore
{
  role: "donor" | "hospital" | "admin",
  email: "user@example.com",
  name: "User Name",
  emailVerified: true | false,
  twoFactorEnabled: true | false,
  phoneNumber: "+639123456789" | "",
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### Security Rules
- Users can only access their own data
- Verification codes are user-specific
- Proper authentication checks throughout
